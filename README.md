# Act-flow-analyses

This folder is for additional analyses investigating activity flow mapping. 

Baddeley's Delta related material attempts to statistically identify areas of the brain that are significantly different 
between PD and control using resting-state functional connectivity.

Also included are investigations into how many components are needed to create a good estimate of activity in one region, 
identifying trends of if certain regions are more informative than others on average across subjects, visualization
of such regions on the brain, and relation of disease status to estimates of functional connectivity.
